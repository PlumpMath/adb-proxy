I tether to my phone as my home internet connection. The built in
tethering doesn't work for some reason (I blame motorola), and I haven't
gotten around to rooting it. This started in January 2015, at which
point my other internet connection wasn't working, and I put something
together using bubblegum, popsicle sticks, and the bit of documentation
I had on my computer already or could look up on my phone.

It's a bit cleaner than it was, and the `useful:hacky` ratio is getting
to the point where I'm no longer embarrassed to tell people about it.
More docs soon, but for now, there are a few tools in here that are a
part of the solution, and the contents of the repository are released
under the GPLv3 or later. Cheers.
